\title{On the Acoustics of Alleyways}


\begin{abstract}
Alleyways bounded by flat, reflective, parallel walls and smooth
concrete floors can produce impulse responses that are surprisingly rich
in texture, featuring a long-lasting modulated tone and a changing
timbre, much like the sound of a didgeridoo. This work explores
alleyway acoustics with acoustic measurements and presents a
computational model based on the image method. Alleyway response
spectrograms show spectral zeros rising in frequency with time, and a
modulated tone lasting noticeably longer than the harmonic series
associated with the distance between the walls. With slight canting of
the walls and floors to produce the long lasting modulated tone, the
image method model captures much of this behavior.

\section{Introduction}

Narrow alleyways with flat, reflective, parallel walls and smooth,
reflective floors have remarkable acoustics, producing strong
harmonics and an evolving timbre. While the harmonics present are
similar to those of a small-diameter acoustic tube whose length is
equal to the wall spacing, the alleyway impulse response is much more
rich in texture, featuring a long lasting modulated tone and a
changing timbre similar to a didgeridoo. In this work, we study alleyway
acoustics through acoustic measurements and a computational model
based on the image method \cite{Allen,Borish} and the well established
theory of acoustic ducts \cite{Morse}.

% Finally, image method models tuned to each alleyway are presented, and their acoustic characteristics compared to the measurements.

\section{Measurements}

Acoustic measurements were made in three alleyways in Palo Alto, CA
with balloon pops, hand claps, and a small clapper similar to an
orchestral whip as sound sources, recorded with INSERT RECORDING EQUIP
HERE (iPhone, hand-held recorder, interface, capsule mics). One was
measured with slow logarithmic sine sweeps, recorded using a MOTU
Traveler Mk3 audio interface, K\&H speaker, and two C-414
microphones. The locations of the microphones and speaker for the sine
sweep impulse response collection in an alleyway adjacent to Printer's
Ink Cafe is shown in Fig.~1.

The impact of the vertical resonant frequencies is better seen in the spectrograms of these impulse responses, but they are so low ($<10$Hz) that their energy is poorly captured by the equipment. % , as they should be around 10Hz for the 8m tall walls...


\section{Modal analysis}

Linear system responses can be thought of as the sum of modal responses. Each of the modal responses represents a resonance with associated damping. We expect the alleyways to have modal responses at integer multiples of half wavelengths of the width of the alleyway (e.g., twice the width). We also expect modes at odd multiples of quarter wavelengths of the distance between the floor and the open ``ceiling," as in an open acoustic tube. These modes are labeled in the spectra in Figs.~2-4, evidencing the strong peaks along the expected harmonic series.

%Modal analysis connects the resonant frequencies seen in the different
% alleyways with their physical dimensions. Duct modes, etc.

\section{Transient response}
Visually inspecting the impulse response and spectrogram reveal many interesting acoustic features. In addition to the weak spectral zeros between the ``wall" harmonics that rise in frequency with time, a modulated tone ($\approx$370 Hz for the 1.85m-wide alleyway, the fourth harmonic) lasts
noticeably longer than the harmonic series associated with the distance between the walls.

\begin{figure}[h!] \centering \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/P14IR_irsg_cropped.pdf} \caption{Logarithmic time scale spectrogram for a measured impulse response, speaker oriented to the West, microphone channel 1.} \end{figure}

\subsection{Onset}
In the impulse response onset (viewed with high time resolution in Fig.~5), spectral zeros increase with time until about 100ms, when they fall back down. We see a modal pattern consistent with our alleyway dimensions, as well as modulation of many of the modes at different rates. The onset also shows correlation between the modulation of modes and the pattern of spectral zeros.

\subsection{Decay}
Figure 6 depicts a high frequency resolution spectrogram of the same impulse response as in Fig.~5, showing more information about the decay of acoustic energy in the alley. We see strong scalloping of individual modes, suggesting multiple closely spaced modes. This is verified by the spectra in Figs.~2-4, which feature nearby peaks to the labeled peaks exist in many cases.

%At the onset of the energy, the response rises and then falls back
%down within the first 100 milliseconds. The tone modulation rate was
%roughly 1.2 Hz, indicating the presence of two modes, very close in
%frequency. The harmonic series lasted a few hundred milliseconds,
%whereas the tone lasted several seconds. 
%
%Fig.~6, with a linear time
%scale, shows more detail of these modulating modes.

\begin{figure}[h!] \centering \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/P14IR_sgm_cropped.pdf} \caption{Spectrogram with linear time scale of a balloon pop of the same impulse response as Fig.~2, showing more detail of the low frequencies and their strong, independent modulation.} \end{figure}

\section{Image model}

The simple geometry of an alleyway with all surfaces meeting at right
angles places image sources in rows parallel to the ground and
perpendicular to the walls, with pairs of image sources spaced every
two alleyway widths apart. At high frequencies, the open alleyway top
is not reflective, and there are two rows, one at the height of the
source, and another below the ground at a depth equal to the negative
source height (Fig.~7). At low frequencies, the top of the alleyway
presents an inverting reflection, and there will be a series of image
source rows above and below the ground, spaced about even multiples of
the alleyway height.

\begin{figure}[h!] \centering \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/ISM_uncanted.pdf} 
\caption{The image source model for an alley with perfectly orthogonal walls, describing the behavior of frequencies with wavelengths shorter than twice the width of the alley.} 
\end{figure}

This image source model produces the following impulse response up to 480 orders of reflection, with the source and microphone in the same positions as in Fig.~1 and the alleyway dimensions of Printer's Ink Alley. The frequency response of painted concrete block was assumed flat, but a small amount of attenuation was applied to account for this.

\begin{figure}[h!] \centering \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/IM_480c00_irsg_cropped.pdf} \caption{Synthesized impulse response and spectrogram of the simple image model for 480 orders of reflection.} \end{figure}

In this response, we see the same diagonals of spectral zeros as in the onset in Fig.~5. These are explained by the relationship between pairs of virtual sources located at $(x,y)$ and $(x,-y)$, and their distance to the microphone: as order increases, this distance approaches 0. Considering the
microphone antennae pattern, speaker radiation pattern (facing the
West wall), and speed of sound in air, we can relate visible peaks in
the impulse response to virtual sources in our model as in Fig.~9.

\begin{figure}[h!] \centering \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/annotated_reflections_v2.pdf} 
\caption{Impulse response for the setup shown in Fig.~1 with speaker
  oriented to the West, first microphone channel oriented West-East, and second microphone channel oriented North-South, annotated with the virtual sources from our
  model. Because the microphones are figure-8, arrivals from the West wall (wall 1) are positive
and the East wall (wall 2) are negative. Gray, vertical lines mark the expected time of arrival of
  reflections coming from virtual sources, and the yellow circles
  label the virtual source index.} %After about 20ms, the sources
%  originating from behind the speaker (e.g., reflecting off of Wall 2)
%  are less evident, and are not labeled. The direct path, first reflection off of Wall 2,
%  and earliest reflections off of the floor are also small in Mic 1,
%  as these arrived in the null of the antennae pattern.}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h!] \centering \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{images/planview_paths_v2.pdf} 
\caption{The first three orders of reflections as viewed from above the alley.} 
\end{figure}

After the `201' source in Fig.~9, no more sources beginning with
`2' (to mean that they originated from the back of the speaker) are
labeled, as they get lost in the noise floor. The very first early reflections hit Mic 1 near its pole, as
well as the direct path, so these events are more evident in the second channel. Soon after these, a clear pattern emerges between the polarity of pulses
and the source location: sources with virtual location $(x,y)$ and
$(x,-y)$ are seen in pairs in the impulse response, getting closer to one another over time
as the angle between the microphone and the pair of sources approaches 0. Therefore, this simple model closely describes what we see in the onset of the impulse response.

Left to explain, then, is the mode splitting we
experience, and the long duration of the transient response. To resolve this, we returned to the
alleyways and measured just how flat and orthogonal the walls actually
were. We discovered small (but significant, given the height of the
walls) angles of canting in half of the walls, as well as a dip
centered on the ground in Mac's Smoke Shop Alley given in Table 1. The resultant model, first with a 0.05m amount of canting in both walls, then with the same canting and a 0.02m dip in the center of the floor, is plotted in Figures 12-13, with the simple image model plotted in Figure 11 for comparison.

\caption{Virtual source locations for an alleyway with no canting. Note that invisible sources appear in the same locations as visible ones: for example, `02' and `20' are in the same location, but because the microphone is above the source, it ``sees" `20' and not the other. This illustrates the \textit{degeneracy} of sources in the simple model, which will not occur in models with canting.} 
\end{figure}

\caption{Virtual source locations for an alleyway with both walls canted in 0.05m. The more complex geometry heeds more sources with distinct positions.}

\caption{Virtual source locations for an alleyway with both walls canted in 0.05m and a dip in the center of the ground of 0.02m.} 
\end{figure}

These more complex constraints lead to a model with sources lying on a
circle centered where the two walls would meet in space were they
extended sufficiently long (the upper blue arc of sources). These are then reflected through the floor to generate another circle of sources (the lowest red arc), and finally, dense arcs of sources that intersect
both of these circles at 90 degree angles.

As the reflection order increases, the distance from the listener to the virtual sources increases roughly linearly, as well as the number of distinct virtual sources that contribute to the response. Because those distinct sources arrive at distinct times (where we once had images with identical locations), the energy does not decay at the expected $1/r$ rate of spherical spreading, but instead more like a $1/\sqrt{r}$ amplitude decay. %This spread in the positions of the 
These ``ripples" of concentric arcs of virtual sources generate the observed mode-splitting, which takes on the form of the strong amplitude modulation due to the beating frequencies.

%\caption{The image sources lie on a circle centered at the point of the wall intersection, if they were extended infinitely through space.} 
%\end{figure}



%These ``ripples" of concentric arcs generate the amplitude modulation
%that we experience. The degree to which energy is reflected back into
%the alleyway at its upper boundary is frequency dependent, and this
%makes for frequency dependent modulation of a given mode.

%Reflection filters for the walls consisting of painted concrete block

%table.

\subsection{Source-Microphone Distance}
From measurements taken with increasing source-microphone distance, we have one more observation about the acoustic behavior of alleyways. With increase in distance, a decreasing chirp frequency at the alleyway response onset becomes more obvious, as illustrated in Fig.~14.

\begin{figure}[h!] \centering \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/P12C_irsg_cropped.pdf} \caption{Spectrograms of four hand claps in Printer's Ink Alley, source moving away each pulse, so the source-microphone distance varies from 4' to 12' to 32' to 44' (microphone near center of alley).} \end{figure}

If the source is proximal to the listener in the alley ($<3$m), the response is more closely represented by a constant loop of arriving source reflections---e.g., the simplified image source model in Fig.~7. These arrivals produce the tone and its harmonic series that we expect, with linearly increasing distance between the listener and image sources. But when the source and listener are more distant, the low-order image sources are roughly the same distance to the listener as the original source and the later arrivals become more separated in time, creating the downward chirp frequency response.

%Measurements were made using a number of source-microphone
%distances. % , including positions between and at the walls and at various heights ranging from on the ground to eye level. 

%The impulse response resulting from the image source model with no canting in the walls is shown in Fig.~13. 

\section{Evaluation and Conclusion}

Impulse responses generated from the image sources reproduce many of
the features of the measured alleyway responses. The harmonic series
and the spectral zeros rising in frequency over time are clearly
visible, and appear to be due to the changing listener arrival times
of signals from the image source row above the ground, relative to the
arrival times from the image source row below the ground.


% Where the image model fails is in the behavior of the spectral zeros

The long lasting modulated tone is not present in the simple image
source model. While the open alleyway top would create an inverting
reflection, thus keeping energy in the alleyway, it would do so only
at frequencies much lower than that of the frequency of the long
lasting tone, which in our measurements is twice that of the inverse
wall spacing. If the alleyway walls are slightly canted inward, the
long lasting tone and its modulation can be produced. In this case,
the modulation can be thought of as a result of the time taken for
sound waves to reflect many times off the alleyway walls, be directed
downwards by the wall cant, and then reflect back upwards from the
ground.
